# 2.0 Preliminary Project Proposal

The goal of the Language-Logic application is to create an application where, when given a sentence can identify prepositional phrases and breakdown its structure in order to output the symbolic logic of the statement. A project like this will allow me to exercise my understanding of language and logic and explore Natural Language Processing, a path that I am extremely interested in, in a structured context .

# 3.0 Project Proposal

## Verbal Description

This project is an exploration into the compatibility between language and computation. Many individuals believe there to be an invisible barrier separating natural language from computers, however what is not understood is that computers are actually designed to understand us, we just have to speak its language. 

With the onset of AI upon us, computers are now being trained to understand humans, talk like humans, and even act like humans. Computers are already better than humans at computational power, however humans still reign supreme in reasoning. One way to bridge that gap is to study how language is used for arguments and adapt that language for a program to understand. Breaking sentences into symbolic logic could end up being like giving a computer a math problem, except instead of 2+2=? The computer could answer “with these symbols”: find the valid output, find the logical flaw, is this statement true. In this structured environment I plan on exploring the grammar of symbolic logic and how humans are taught to break down the statements in order to come up with the correct solution.

The application will be written in Python due to its access to large parsing libraries and applicability to a webpage or console input/output.

## Justification

I have always had a bittersweet relationship with language: despite being in the most anti-literature major, I enjoy storytelling (can you believe that I ran a creative writing club in high school). Even though my vocabulary is absolute trash, I find words fascinating and worth studying. Maybe it is because I am algebraically driven, but I’ve always understood writing as a pseudo equation. Certain words tied together can draw out completely different meanings, even if the theme of the statements are the same. Due to this it is safe to assume that words have a defined value and adding certain values together can lead to a specific solution. This becomes most applicable in arguments where one party applies their verbal value against another party’s verbal strength. This is why we have lawyers, we hire individuals who are experts with words to defend our property and rights. Imagine if there existed a computer that could act as a judge: that took in the arguments of both lawyers, computed their argument value dexterity against one another, and gave judgement. Judgement could potentially become more consistent (or we would be putting our whole liberty into the hands of a really smart terminator bot).
