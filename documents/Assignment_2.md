# Assignment #2

## 5.1: What's the difference between a component-based architecture and a service-oriented architecture?

## 5.2: Suppose you're building a phone application that lets you play tic-tac-toe against a simple computer opponent. It will display high scores stored on the phone, not in an external database. Which architectures would be most appropriate and why?

## 5.4: Repeat question 3 [after thinking about it; it repeats question 2 for a chess game] assuming the chess program lets two users play against each other over an Internet connection.

## 5.6: What kind of database structure and maintenance should the ClassyDraw application use?

## 5.8: Draw a state machine diagram to let a program read floating point numbers in scientific notation as in +37 or -12.3e+17 (which means -12.3 x 1017). Allow both E and e for the exponent symbol.

## 6.1: Consider the ClassyDraw classes Line, Rectangle, Ellipse, Star, and Text. What properties do these classes all share? What properties do they not share? Are there any properties shared by some classes and not others? Where should the shared and nonshared properties be implemented?

## 6.2: Draw an inheritance diagram showing the properties you identified for Exercise 1. (Create parent classes as needed, and don't forget the Drawable class at the top.)

## 6.3:
